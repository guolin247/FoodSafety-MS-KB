'6:2 FTS' stands for 6:2 Fluorotelomer Sulfonate. '13C2,D4' indicates labeling with two Carbon-13 and four Deuterium atoms. A definitive match was found in PubChem (via the EPA CompTox Dashboard), corresponding to 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid with labels at positions 1 and 2 of the ethyl chain (1,2-13C2) and all four hydrogens on that chain replaced by deuterium (1,1,2,2-D4). This compound is a standard used in environmental analysis and does not have a registered CAS number. The Canonical SMILES in the corresponding PubChem entry appears to be incorrectly generated (representing a branched isomer), so a corrected SMILES representing the correct linear structure is provided here.",C8H5F13O3S,506.002011,O=S(=O)(O)[13C]([2H])([2H])[13C]([2H])([2H])C(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(F)(F)C(F)(F)F,139158338.0,LLM_VertexAI
